# Vector Music Desktop Application

Vector Music Desktop Application is a lightweight music player developed using Java Swing and AWT components. This project demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and multithreading in Java. 

## Features

- **File Format Support**: Play music files in `.WAV`, `.AU`, and `.AIFF` formats.
- **Multithreading**: Ensures smooth playback and user interactions without performance interruptions.
- **Swing and AWT UI**: A simple and responsive user interface designed using Java Swing and AWT components.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **AWT Components**: For handling low-level UI components and operations.
- **OOP Principles**: For a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Multithreading**: For concurrent task execution, enabling seamless playback and user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure JDK 8 or later is installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **Terminal or Command Prompt**: To compile and run the application.

### Steps to Compile and Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Compile the Application**:  
   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:  
   ```bash
   javac -encoding UTF-8 -d bin -sourcepath src src/Main.java
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:  
   After compiling, execute the program by running:  
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

4. **Load Music Files**:  
   Use the application's file loader to load `.WAV`, `.AU`, or `.AIFF` files and enjoy playback.


## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or later installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java Swing and AWT for modifications or contributions.
